    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Chicken Crispers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>1 chipotle pepper, finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce from the can</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chicken breasts into strips about 3 inches long. </li>
        <li>Stir buttermilk and hot sauce together in a medium bowl. Add chicken to buttermilk mixture and toss well to completely cover the chicken. Let stand 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour vegetable oil into a large saucepan or very deep skillet to about 4 inches deep.  Heat oil to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). </li>
        <li>In a large shallow dish, whisk together flour, kosher salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and baking powder until well combined. </li>
        <li>Remove each tender from buttermilk mixture and coat lightly with flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Return chicken to buttermilk mixture and finish with a second coat of flour mixture. Set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully add chicken tenders to hot oil and cook, flipping occasionally, until crispy golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels or a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. </li>
        <li>For sauce, whisk barbecue sauce, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, and honey together in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt. Serve chicken with sauce.</li>
    </ol>
